defmodule HacLong.TienLen.RoomServer do
  @moduledoc """
  One process per room (RULES T13, T15, T16, T17).

  - **Serialises** every command for the room, so near-simultaneous commands (e.g. two
    out-of-turn four-pairs) are applied in arrival order and the first valid one wins.
  - **Turn timer** (default 20 s): restarted whenever the turn changes hands or the current
    player acts; on expiry the server acts for the player (`HacLong.TienLen.Room.turn_timeout/1`).
  - **Connections**: `join/3` monitors the calling process (the player's LiveView). When the
    last process of a player goes down they are marked disconnected, and after the disconnect
    timeout (default 20 s) they are removed from the current game (`Room.disconnect_timeout/2`).
    Joining again with the same player id before that cancels the timer.
  - **Broadcasts** `{:room_updated, room_id, version, events}` on `topic(room_id)` after every
    change. Events are public facts only (plays, passes, joins…); subscribers fetch their own
    projection with `view/2`. Hands, undealt cards and seeds are never broadcast.
  - Stops (`:normal`) when the last player leaves, when nobody has been connected for the
    disconnect timeout, or when nobody joins within that time after creation (X9).
  - Tells the lobby (`HacLong.TienLen.Lobby.topic/0`) when its summary may have changed
    (`{:lobby_updated, id}`) and when it closes (`{:room_closed, id}`).
  - `view/2` answers only seated players; spectators use `watch/1` and `spectator_view/1` (V1).
  - After every change the commentator (`HacLong.TienLen.Commentary`, BL1) may post lines in the room
    chat; players can throw items at each other (`throw/4`, TH1).

  Options for `start_room/1`: `:id`, `:turn_timeout` and `:disconnect_timeout` (ms), `:deals` (a
  list of `HacLong.TienLen.Room.deal()` used for successive games, for tests; otherwise a fresh
  `HacLong.TienLen.Deck.new_seed/0` per game).
