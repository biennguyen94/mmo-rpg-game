defmodule HacLong.TienLen.Game do
  @moduledoc """
  One game of Tiến Lên, as a pure state machine (RULES T2, T3, T7–T12, T15 effects, T16
  actions, T18 flow).

  No processes, timers or randomness: the room process (Phase 6) owns timers and calls
  `timeout/2` and `remove/2`. Every command names the acting seat explicitly and is validated
  for that seat (T17). Commands return `{:ok, game, events}` or `{:error, reason}` and never
  raise on bad input.

  ## Seats

  `seats` is the list of players taking part, **in turn order** (counter-clockwise). Seats
  can be any terms (integers, ids).

  ## Phases

  - `:lead` — `current` must play any valid combination (no pass, D3). On the first play
    of a card-led game it must contain `opening_card` (T3).
  - `:respond` — `current` beats the centre or passes. Any active player may chop out of
    turn with a four-pair (T10).
  - `:finished` — `ranking` is set.

  ## Events (public information only)

  `{:played, seat, combo}`, `{:chopped, seat, combo}` (out of turn), `{:passed, seat}`,
  `{:timed_out, seat}`, `{:finished, seat, position}`, `{:removed, seat}`,
  `{:round_ended, leader}`, `{:lead_moved, leader}`, `{:game_over, ranking}`,
  `{:chop_chain, %{payer, payee, units, chops}}` (when a round's chop chain ends, E3/T23;
  `units` = value of the chopped 2s in stakes × number of chops).

  ## Error reasons

  `:game_over`, `:not_in_game`, `:not_active` (finished or removed), `:not_your_turn`,
  `:not_your_cards`, plus every reason from `HacLong.TienLen.Rules`.
