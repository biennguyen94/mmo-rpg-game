defmodule HacLong.TienLen.Room do
  @moduledoc """
  A room: up to 4 seats, a host, and a sequence of games (RULES T2, T13, T15; D8, R1, R4, R6,
  I5, S5, S6).

  Pure: `HacLong.TienLen.RoomServer` owns timers and connections and calls these functions.

  ## Seats and players

  Seats are integers `0..3`; ascending seat order is the turn order (counter-clockwise), and
  seat numbers are what `HacLong.TienLen.Game` sees. A *player id* is an opaque term that identifies
  a person (a signed token in Phase 7); `join/3` with the same id again is a reconnect.

  ## Next game's leader (T2)

  `last_winner` holds the player id of the previous game's 1st place, or `nil` when the
  previous game ended by instant win (I5) or none was played. If that player takes part in the
  next game, they lead it (winner-led, R1); otherwise the game is card-led (R4).

  ## Participants

  A game is dealt to the **connected** seated players only (interpretation X6). A disconnected
  player keeps their seat and plays again from the next game after reconnecting (S5).
